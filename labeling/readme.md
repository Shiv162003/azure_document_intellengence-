### **Best Practices for Labeling Data in Azure Form Recognizer**

1. **Understand Your Data**  
   - Identify the structure and type of documents (e.g., invoices, receipts, forms) you want to process.
   - Familiarize yourself with the layout and variations in document formats to account for all possible inputs.

2. **Use Clear and Consistent Labels**  
   - Label fields with intuitive and descriptive names that reflect their purpose, such as "Invoice Number" or "Total Amount."
   - Avoid overly generic labels (e.g., "Field1") to make debugging and scaling easier.

3. **Ensure High-Quality Samples**  
   - Use clear and legible documents with good resolution (at least 200 DPI) for training.
   - Include a mix of real-world samples that represent all variations (e.g., different templates, orientations, and fonts) to improve generalization.

4. **Account for Noise and Imperfections**  
   - Include samples with common imperfections like folds, smudges, or slight skewing to ensure the model can handle noisy data.
   - Avoid heavily distorted or unreadable samples, as they might degrade model performance.

5. **Diversify the Training Data**  
   - Ensure a diverse dataset by including variations in:
     - Document templates.
     - Languages or scripts, if applicable.
     - Content density and formatting (e.g., single-column vs. multi-column layouts).

6. **Label All Relevant Fields**  
   - Label every field you want the model to extract, even if it doesn’t appear in every document. Consistency across training samples is crucial for robust model training.
   - Avoid labeling unnecessary fields to reduce noise and training complexity.

7. **Use the Labeling Tool Effectively**  
   - Leverage Azure's **Custom Form Training Tool** to simplify and standardize the labeling process.
   - Double-check labeled fields for accuracy and ensure no fields are missed.

8. **Ensure Consistent Field Boundaries**  
   - Use bounding boxes or polygons that tightly enclose the field text.
   - Avoid overlapping or incorrectly positioned bounding boxes, as they can confuse the model.

9. **Maintain Labeling Consistency**  
   - If a field spans multiple lines (e.g., multiline addresses), decide on a consistent strategy, such as labeling the entire block as one entity or splitting it into components.
   - For repeating fields (like item lists), ensure each instance is labeled consistently.

10. **Prepare a Balanced Dataset**  
    - Balance the dataset by ensuring an equal representation of common and rare fields to prevent bias in predictions.
    - Include enough examples for each labeled field to ensure sufficient learning.

11. **Validate Labels Before Training**  
    - Review the labeled data for accuracy and consistency using the Azure labeling tool.
    - Regularly validate the dataset to catch and correct human errors.

12. **Iterate and Improve**  
    - Start with a smaller, well-labeled dataset for initial testing, and iteratively add more labeled samples as needed.
    - Use feedback from the model’s predictions to refine labels and improve training quality.

13. **Use Prebuilt Models for Common Use Cases**  
    - For documents like invoices or receipts, consider starting with Azure's prebuilt models and adding custom fields to reduce labeling effort.

14. **Follow Compliance Standards**  
    - Ensure all data labeling complies with privacy and regulatory requirements, especially for sensitive information like personal identification or financial data.

15. **Monitor Model Performance Post-Training**  
    - Test the trained model on unseen documents to verify its accuracy and ability to generalize.
    - Re-label and retrain the model if performance gaps are identified.
